## Usage
### Requirements
```
Python3
Keras 2.2.4 with Tensorflow 1.13.0 as backend. 
```
### Dataset
Part of the dataset is available on [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZzEBMiVtFgZvWW7WYeJxIA 
) 7u69



## PS
Some of the core code has been uploaded.

Once the project is complete, all the code will be uploaded.

The dataset is only partially exposed by enterprise requirements, but is large enough to be used to train a small model, as explained in our article
